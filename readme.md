# WP Archive AJAX
## Fun on the Farm Sanctuary

___


The following Twenty Seventeen child theme uses the category arhive page to run custom queries that display different post_types that all share the category of "animals". AJAX is used liberally, especially for the chicken carousel/pagination feature.

This is adapted from a work project that had a unique set of requirements. Your milage may vary. The author is not responsible for any fits, vapors, or fainting spells that result from seeing archive.php used in such a way.
